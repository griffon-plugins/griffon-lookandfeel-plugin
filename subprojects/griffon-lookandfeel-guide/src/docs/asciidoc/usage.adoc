This plugin adds a `{api_lookandfeel_manager}` helper class that takes care of configuring the Look&Feel of a
Swing application provided the following entries are available in the application's configuration

|===
| Property               | Type               | Default
| lookandfeel.handler    | String             | System
| lookandfeel.theme      | String             | System
| lookandfeel.properties | Map<String,Object> |
|===

The `properties` key is optional. If defined it will be used to fill properties in the `javax.swing.UIManager`.
